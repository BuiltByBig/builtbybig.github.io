      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Software development and consulting for start-ups</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We specialize in bringing new ideas to life.</strong> Work with us to take
        your business concept and turn it into a living, breathing software product
        or service. We know intimately how to deliver quality software quickly and
        on budget.</p>
      <p>We work closely with you to create the best possible product/service while
        still hitting budgets and timelines.</p>
      <p>Our team will work with you every step of the way, helping you make the best
        possible technical decisions for your business.</p>
      <p>We understand the shifting nature of business and thus do everything to make
        the software we write flexible and adapted for change and evolution. We won't
        need a full re-write every time your business needs to pivot.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Project rescue</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Are you unhappy with your software?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does it take days or weeks for your developers to get back to you when you
          need them?</li>
        <li>
          Have you had a developer disappear on you and abandon your project?
        </li>
        <li>Is it slow and expensive to add even the simplest feature?</li>
        <li>Do you feel like your money is just disappearing with no clear value being
          created for your business?</li>
        <li>Is your application crashing even under minimal load?</li>
        <li>Are your customers continually unhappy with your product?</li>
        <li>Do pages take forever to load or even crash completely?</li>
        <li>Do you have no confidence in the code you've paid for?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We've worked on countless projects where past developers have underwhelmed
        our customers. Whether they're slow, difficult to communicate with or deliver
        poor quality software, we've seen it all and we're here to help.</p>
      <p>Work with a California based team committed to working closely with you to
        build the software your business needs, and nothing you don't.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Expanding your team</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Are you overwhelmed with your products success and your team can't catch
          up?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>At BIG, we often work with clients who become crippled by their own success.
        If your team is struggling to catch up to customer demands, let us work directly
        with them to expand your capacity and hit deadlines.</p>
      <p>We are familiar with most software stacks with an emphasis on JavaScript projects
        (Node, React in particular) and we can get up to speed and delivering software
        quickly and painlessly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-xl" id="ethos">
      <h2 class="section-heading">Our Ethos</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Software built with love</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We believe quality software stands the test of time.</strong> We care about
        the work we do and take pride in building software that is well made, resilient,
        maintainable and tested. We think about all the little details and make sure
        all the “i”s are dotted and the “t”s are crossed. If you care about building
        a business that lasts, the details matter a whole lot.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clear, consistent communication</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Without great communication, you can’t build great software.</strong>
        That is why communication is at the core of what we do here. From our weekly meetings
        to our regular stand ups to our collaborative code review, we focus on making
        sure all those involved in a project have a full understanding of their role,
        what’s expected of them and when things are to be done.</p>
      <p>We accomplish this with various tools and techniques that you will become familiar
        with when working with us. As a client of ours, you’ll never be left high
        and dry with a developer that just drops off the face of the earth. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Software you can depend on</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>You should have confidence in your software.</strong> We take reliability
        and stability seriously because no business should be relying on untested,
        unreliable and poorly crafted software. Our approach involves insuring there
        are checks and balances in place to only produce the best software.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-xl" id="process">
      <h2 class="section-heading">Our Process</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Agile development process</h3>
      <p>At BIG, we believe
        <strong>process builds great software</strong> and we continually strive to refine
        our development process to make the best possible software. We follow a simple
        and pragmatic "Agile"-style development process that we find builds exceptional
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Decide a certain feature is no longer needed? Want to add something? Want
          to dedicate more/less resources to the project?</em> No problem, we will
        just make adjustments for the next sprint.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Test driven software design</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Quality software is tested and verified.</strong> You can never truly have
        confidence (and thus a good nights sleep) if you can’t verify that the software
        you have is tested and that the most recent changes you’ve made didn’t break
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>Using Test Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration and Continuous
        Deployment we create a system that ensures we launch high-quality, well tested
        code quickly so you can sleep well knowing your software works.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Peer review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We believe two heads are better than one.</strong> All changes that are made
        to your project will be peer reviewed by a senior developer to ensure that
        the changes made are done in the best possible way. Research has continually
        shown that code review is one of the most important factors in creating (near)
        bug-free software.</p>
      <p>Every agile sprint ends with one or more “Pull Requests” (basically an isolated
        change to the software) that will be reviewed by another developer to give
        feedback on the particular solution and possible alternative approaches,
        ensuring testing and documentation were updated and that the code follows
        the style guidelines for the project. This process ensures every change is
        as well thought out as possible, thus making the best possible software.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Quality by design</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We strive for software that is designed to last a lifetime.</strong> We take
        pride in our work and you will see that in the software we produce.</p>
      <p>Software projects are complex and the people working on them change over time.
        To ensure this predictable change is as painless as possible, we document
        our projects so the onboarding of new developers (or if you so choose, moving
        to another company) will go as smoothly as possible. We care about your project
        even after we are done working on it.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bonafide: Product Redesign</h3>
        <p>Bonafide brought in BIG to modernize their application frontend. They are
          one of the biggest and most established players in their space and have
          been around for over a dozen years so they developed a lot of technical
          debt in the software, including many different interface versions throughout
          the application. BIG worked with their team to design and implement a new
          and improved UX (User Experience) focused on reducing the time and energy
          needed for users to find the information important to them. Our team created
          a new UI (User Interface) aesthetic and developed frontend components using
          React to incrementally improve their product.</p>

        <p>Swinerton Builders is one of the largest solar power plant contractors in
          the United States. Sunscreen is a tablet application that completely removed
          the need for Swinerton's team on contractors to use huge stacks of paper
          blueprints on the job site and made managing, tracking, and reporting drastically
          easier for their team.</p>
        <p>BIG was hired to assist in developing the web interface for their new site
          management platform. The existing version of the interface wasn't ready
          to support the real-time nature of the information flowing through the
          system, so we developed a framework of UI components using React and Redux.</p>

        <p>BIG developed a React Native mobile application and an embedded API server.
          We worked with the Sisyphus team to develop the project from idea all the
          way to its successful funding on Kickstarter including initial brainstorming,
          iterative MVP creation and marketing.</p>
        <p>The mobile application allows an owner of a Sisyphus table to control speed

        <p>Zovida is a modern twist on traditional Learning Management Systems (LRS).
          We worked directly with the business founder from the original ideation
          phase into it being sold to its first customers. BIG oversaw one other
          developer on creating an MVP using Node of a standard LRS review/quiz/survey
          flow. We managed to keep the initial project simple and sold the initial
          concept to a customer with over 1700 employees who was onboarded seamlessly.
          We built just enough functionality to enable our client to save on costs
          while still attracting clients and being flexible for the future.</p>
        <p>Working closely with founder Parker, we built a fully tested application,
          delivered in less than 6 weeks, on budget and on time which was immediately
          able to onboard new customers.</p>
        <p>We have continually worked with Zovida to evolve their business including
