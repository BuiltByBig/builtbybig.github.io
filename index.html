      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transparency</h3>
      <p>We believe that being transparent is part of good communication and that if
        you do good work and care about your customers, transparency is a natural
        result of that relationship. We are transparent about our pricing, how we
        work and (see below)
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Craftsmanship</h3>
      <p>We believe quality software stands the test of time. We care about the work
        we do and take pride in building software that is well built, resilient,
        maintainable and tested. We think about all the little details and make sure
        all the “i”s are dotted and the “t”s are crossed. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Communication</h3>
      <p>Without clear, effective and timely communication, you can’t build great software.
        That is why communication is at the core of what we do here. From our weekly
        meetings to our regular stand ups to our collaborative code review, we focus
        on making sure all those involved in a project have a full understanding
        of their role, what’s expected of them and when things are to be done. We
        accomplish this with various tools and techniques that you will become familiar
        with when working with us. As a client of ours, you’ll never be left high
        and dry with a developer that just drops off the face of the earth. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-xl" id="process">
      <h2 class="section-heading">How We Work</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Agile development process</h3>
      <p>At our weekly “Sprint Meeting”, you will have a chance to make adjustments
        to the flow of the project. Decide a certain feature is no longer needed?
        Want to add something? Want to dedicate more/less resources to the project?
        No problem, we will just make adjustments for the next sprint. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Test driven software design</h3>
      <p>Quality software is tested and verified. You can never truly have confidence
        (and thus a good nights sleep) if you can’t verify that the software you
        have is tested and that the most recent changes you’ve made didn’t break
        anything. Using Test Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration and
        Continuous Deployment we create a system that ensures we launch high-quality,
        well tested code regularly. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Documentation by design</h3>
      <p>Software projects are complex and the people working on them change over time.
        To ensure this predictable change is as painless as possible, we document
        our projects so the onboarding of new developers (or if you so choose, moving
        to another company) will go as smoothly as possible. In addition, we strive
        for software that is legible, concise and clear so that any reasonably experienced
        developer can quickly make changes with confidence. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-heading">Peer review</h3>
      <p>All changes that are made to your project will be peer reviewed by a senior
        developer to ensure that the changes made are done in the best possible way.
        Research has continually shown that code review is one of the most important
        factors in creating bug-free software. Every sprint ends with a “Pull Request”
        (basically an isolated change to the software) that will be reviewed by another
        developer to give feedback on the particular solution and possible alternative
        approaches, ensuring testing and documentation were updated and that the
        code follows the style guidelines for the project. This process ensures every
        change is as well thought out as possible, thus making the best possible
        software. </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bonafide: Product Redesign</h3>
        <p>Bonafide brought in BIG to modernize their application frontend. They are
          one of the biggest and most established players in their space and have
          been around for many years so they developed a lot of technical debt in
          the frontends, including many different interface versions throughout the
          application. BIG worked with their team to design and implement a new and
          improved User Experience focused on reducing the time and energy needed
          for users to find the information important to them. Our team created a
          new UI aesthetic and developed frontend components using React to incrementally
          improve their product. </p>

        <p>Developed a system to manage the internal production process of Harvester,
          a local t-shirt print shop. The application allows designers to review
          and approve production runs of print jobs and production staff a reference
          and workflow to ensuring accurate and consistent printing.</p>

        <p>Swinerton Builders is one of the largest solar power plant contractors in
          the United States. Sunscreen is a tablet application that completely removed
          the need for Swinerton's team on contractors to use huge stacks of paper
          blueprints on the job site and made managing, tracking, and reporting drastically
          easier for their team.</p>

        <p>BIG was hired to assist in developing the web interface for their new site
          management platform. The existing version of the interface wasn't ready
          to support the real-time nature of the information flowing through the
          system, so we developed a framework of UI components using React and Redux.</p>

        <p>Developed a React Native mobile application and oversaw project management
          for a successful crowd-funded kinetic art piece. The project raised $1.9mm+
          on KickStarter. Myself and another developer who worked on the embedded
          API server, developed the project from idea all the way to its successful
          funding on Kickstarter including initial brainstorming, iterative MVP creation
          and marketing. The mobile application allows an owner of a Sisyphus table
          to control speed and brightness, change pattern playlists and pause/resume
          movement; similar to a music player in functionality.</p>

        <p>We worked closely with a local agency, ZDCA, to develop a nutrient calculator
          widget for VEG+BLOOM's new Shopify website. We leveraged React to create
          a performant, reliable and beautiful calculator that determines the proper
          product amounts and recommended product types based on a variety of criteria.</p>

        <p>Zovida is a modern twist on traditional Learning Management Systems (LRS).
          We worked directly with the business founder from the original ideation
          phase into it being sold to its first customers. BIG oversaw one other
          developer on creating an MVP using Node of a standard LRS review/quiz/survey
          flow. We managed to keep the initial project simple and sold the initial
          concept to a customer with over 1700 employees who was onboarded seamlessly.
          We built just enough functionality to enable our client to save on costs
          while still attracting clients and being flexible for the future.</p>
        <p>Working closely with founder Parker, we built a fully tested application,
          delivered in less than 6 weeks, on budget and on time.</p>
